Yii 2 API Project Template
===============================

Yii 2 API Project Template is a skeleton [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) application best for
developing complex Web applications with multiple tiers.

The template includes three tiers: front end, back end, api, and console, each of which
is a separate Yii application.

The template is designed to work in a team development environment. It supports
deploying the application in different environments.

INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.0.0"
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev wfcreations/yii2-app-api app
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `basic` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/api/web/
http://localhost/backend/web/
http://localhost/frontend/web/
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `common/config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2app',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTE:** Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
